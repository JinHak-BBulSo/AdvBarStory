11,Kamerina,Ummmm..
12,Siela,What are you talking about? Have you lost your mind?
13,Strange Man,Is this your little Sister? Go to the other room while we talk.
14,Siela,What? This is MY house! We're never goint to sell it!
15,Fred,Siela  you there? Hello? I brought you vegetables. What the.. What is going on in here..?
16,Strange Man,Oh goodness. I'll try another day.
17,Kamerina,Just think about it  Kamerina
18,Siela,What is he talking about  selling this place? Who does he think he is?!
19,Gustav,His name is Gustav. He wants us to sell the restaurant.
20,Siela,This isn't the first time you met him? Why didn't you tell me about him!!
21,Kamerina,Well.. That's because I didn't want you to worry.
22,Siela,You've got to tell me! Why does he want us to sell the house?
23,Kamerina,I don't know exactly. But I assume it has to do with the location of this house.
,,He wants to buy this property and move his restaurant  Cassel Garden  here.
24,Siela,What? Really? Is there anything we can do to stop him?
25,Fred,Did you say Cassel Garden? This is going to be trickier  than I thought.
26,Siela,Why
27,Fred,Cassel Garden is the most well-known restaurant in the Kingdom of Cassel
,,I've heard numerous rumors about this guy. And I'm talking about bad rumors.
,,He will try anything to get his way. Even if that means screwing over other restaurants ...
,,He has connections with the Royal Family. Soldiers will not be able to stop him either.
28,Siela,No way..
29,Fred,Even if you said you weren't going to sell the house  he'd try to take it from you.
30,Siela,No! We're not going to let that happen.
,,We lived here with our parents. There are too many great memories.
31,Fred,You're right.
32,Siela,What shall we do?
33,Kamerina,Hhmmm..
34,Fred,There is one thing you could do..
35,Siela,Really? What  Fred?
36,Fred,Cassel Garden has both the financial and political advantage.
,,If you face Gustav head on  you will lose.
37,Siela,..Yes.
38,Fred,Siela  you just have to work hard and make your restaurant as successful as Cassel Garden.
39,Siela,What? That's not going to happen..
40,Fred,So you're fine with Gustav taking your place?
41,Siela,No  not at all.
42,Fred,Siela you have potential. You have more talent than Kamerina
43,Siela,Why  thank you! But  how do I start?
44,Fred,Let's see..
,,Thant's right! How about the cooking contest?!
45,Siela,Cooking contest?
46,Fred,If I remember correctly  they have it several times a month at the castle.
,,If you win the contest it will be great publicity!
47,Siela,I've never really taken part in a contest before..
48,Fred,You have to try! If you don't do this  there's no  future left for you.
49,Siela,..
,,Alright! I'm going to give it a try.
50,Fred,That's the spirit!
51,Siela,Starting today  I'm going to be in charge of this restaurant!
52,Kamerina,That's fine. But  are you sure Siela? Can you handle it?
53,Siela,Yes  of course! I still need your support though!
,,You too Fred!
54,Fred,Whaaat! Me too?
55,Siela,You're the one who suggested this whole idea! You're going to take responsibility and help me!
56,Fred,I can't cook though.. I'll make sure to give you advice on other areas!
,,The common ingredients you can buy from my store. But others  you must go get them by foot.
,,If you go to the meadow outside of town  you will be able to get many ingredients for free!
,,If you're going. I'll join you.
57,Siela,Thank you! Now  let's do this. Watch out  Cassel Garden!
58,Fred,Ah! Before you go off into the world full of monsters  visit my shop to buy items and equipment!
,,We need to prepare well.
